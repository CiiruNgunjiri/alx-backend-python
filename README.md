README.md: You are here!

✨ Features You’ll Love
Modern, readable code: Python 3.7+, full type annotations, and meaningful docstrings everywhere.

Rock-solid testing: Unittest framework, parameterized test cases, and advanced mocking for reliability.

CI/CD Ready: All code meets pycodestyle 2.5 (PEP8) — plug in to any workflow with confidence.

Easy to extend: Modular, documented, and ready for your next feature.

No hidden requirements: Everything is explicit, from imports to permissions.

⚙️ Requirements
OS: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

Python: 3.7

Testing: unittest, parameterized, mock

Style: PEP8 using pycodestyle 2.5

Documentation: Every file, class, function, and coroutine is fully and professionally documented.

🚦 Quickstart
1. Install Dependencies
pip3 install parameterized

2. Make Tests Executable
chmod +x testclient.py testutils.py

3. Run Your Tests
./testclient.py
./testutils.py
# orpython3 testclient.py
python3 testutils.py

4. Check Code Style
pycodestyle --version      # Expect 2.5.*
pycodestyle *.py

🧩 Code Style & Contribution Guidelines
Always start files with: #!/usr/bin/env python3

End every file with a single newline

Every function, method, class, and module has a full, meaningful docstring

All public interfaces are type-annotated

Use only spaces for indentation (never tabs!)

Contributions should pass all provided tests and pycodestyle checks

💡 Why This Template?
Clean, readable, and future-proof: Quickly adds value to any Python codebase.

Testing is not an afterthought: Serious about both correctness and maintainability.

Frictionless developer onboarding: Clear structure and instructions for everyone.
