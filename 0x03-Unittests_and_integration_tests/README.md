## Project Overview

This project demonstrates comprehensive unit and integration testing in Python, focusing on:

- Testing utility functions (`utils.py`).
- Testing a GitHub organization client (`client.py`).
- Employing mocking, parameterization, and fixtures.
- Adhering to Python best practices including typing, PEP 8 style, and documentation.

---

## Background

Effective testing is foundational to maintainable and reliable software development. This project showcases:

- **Unit testing** to isolate and verify discrete pieces of code behavior.
- **Integration testing** to validate the interaction across different components, using mocked external requests with pre-canned fixtures to simulate real-world API responses.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/CiiruNgunjiri/alx-backend-python.git
cd alx-backend-python/0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests

2. **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'

3. **Install dependencies:**

pip install -r requirements.txt

> **Note:** If `requirements.txt` is not present, install key packages manually:
>
> ```
> pip install parameterized
> ```

---

## Usage

All scripts and tests are written in Python 3 and executed with Python 3.7+.

- Scripts include a shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) for executability.
- All source files comply with PEP 8 styling rules.
- Functions and methods are annotated with types.

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Located in `test_utils.py` and part of `test_client.py`.
- Test functions include:
- `access_nested_map`: Check key path traversal and error handling.
- `get_json`: Ensures correct JSON response fetching (mocked requests).
- `memoize`: Validates caching behavior of methods.
- `GithubOrgClient` methods, including `.org()`, `.has_license()`, `.public_repos()`.
- Utilize:
- `unittest` for testing framework.
- `parameterized` for testing multiple inputs conveniently.
- `unittest.mock` to patch external HTTP calls and dependencies.

### Integration Tests

- Located in `test_client.py` under the class `TestIntegrationGithubOrgClient`.
- Use fixtures from `fixtures.py` to simulate API responses.
- Patch `requests.get` to avoid real network calls while testing full method interactions.
- Validate that actual logic correctly processes provided fixture data.

---

### Running the Tests

From the root of your project, run all tests with:

python -m unittest discover -s 0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests -p "test_*.py"

Or run individual test modules:

python -m unittest 0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests.test_utils
python -m unittest 0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests.test_client

---

## Code Quality and Style

- All code complies with [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
- Enforced with `pycodestyle` (version 2.5).
- Every file ends with a newline.
- Functions and methods include full docstrings explaining purpose and behavior.
- Type annotations are present for all functions and methods.

---

## Documentation

- Docstrings exist at all levels:
  - Module-level documentation in every script.
  - Class docstrings explaining intent.
  - Method and function docstrings clarifying parameters and behavior.
- Documentation follows the style checked by Python's built-in help utilities.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to branch (`git push origin feature/my-feature`).
5. Open a Pull Request.

Please ensure all new code includes appropriate tests and documentation.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7+
- `parameterized` — for parameterized tests.
- `unittest` — standard Python testing framework.
- `unittest.mock` — for patching/mocking in tests.

Install dependencies via:

pip install parameterized

Or from `requirements.txt` if available.
